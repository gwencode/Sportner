# Name
Sportner 

## Description 

Sportner is a Web-App that connects sportsmen to do common sport outings (running and surf, for now).

It also allows to discover new surf spots, to do carpooling and to chat between the participants of a same sport outing.

## Technologies used 

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Figma, Webpack, Heroku

## Context 

This Web-App was the final project made at the end of the 9-weeks coding bootcamp of [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com). It was developped with 3 other people in 2 weeks : 
- [Cl√©ment Cordeiro](https://github.com/Clementcordeiro)
- [Olivier Kermoal](https://github.com/Satomishi)
- [Matthieu Nourry](https://github.com/MatthieuNO)

At the end of the 2 weeks, I pitched the project in front of 70 people (tech firms, Le Wagon's students, former students and teachers).

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
